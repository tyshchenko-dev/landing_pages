						Compared to other blockchains, Aleo uses the rare "Zero null Edge"
						techlogology, which makes it not only safer than other blockchains
						but also allows it to easily combine its web services with others.

						The financial incentive will always be there for The Aleo Foundation
						to constantly develop and improve them, regardless of how or where
						they are used. This is because of the aforementioned Proof of
						Necessary Work function that will be employed by Aleo.

					<p>
						What Aleo gains by having first-mover advantage on a PoW function
						that is functionally equivalent to work that is inexorably linked to
						the processing of SNARKs, is assurances that the most efficient
						place on the planet for the processing of “SNARK Work” will be the
						Aleo mining pool itself. Once dedicated hardware (ASICs) begin to be
						iteratively developed for the mining of Aleo, these units will
						become the most efficient processing units for blockchain SNARK
						work, and therefore presumably if anyone wants to produce
						zero-knowledge proofs, that work may well be done on an Aleo ASIC.
						As a result, Aleo miners will perform SNARK-work and mining based on
						demand and profitability of both.

						Thus, Aleo’s economics imply that the native Aleo currency will
						become an economic index that tracks the value of zero-knowledge
						proofs and their applications.
